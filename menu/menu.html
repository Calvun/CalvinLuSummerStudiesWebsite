        <h1>STUDY THIS <b id = "summer">Summer</b></h1>
        <p>It is never too early to start planning your summer! Many structured summer programs and camps have deadlines in January and February. This Summer Program Sampler is meant to be a sampling of summer programs; it is not an exhaustive list. For more opportunities, please visit www.summerprogramfinder.com, www.enrichmentalley.com, www.teenlife.com, or www.google.com. </p><br>
        <p>You donâ€™t have to pay for a structured summer program in order to have a valuable summer experience! Colleges are just as excited about students who work at paying jobs or spend their summers volunteering. For community service ideas, please visit www.dosomething.org, view a listing of local opportunities in Naviance (http://connection.naviance.com/steds/), or see your college counselor.</p>
